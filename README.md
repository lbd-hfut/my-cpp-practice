# my-cpp-practice
This is my first C++ program in Debian12

This is the beginning of my C++ learning journey, a new chapter full of challenges and opportunities. On this road, I know that I will encounter countless difficulties and confusions, but every time I overcome them, I will take a solid step towards mastery. I am determined to explore the deep and vast programming world of C++ with unremitting efforts, from basic syntax to advanced features, from algorithm logic to data structure, step by step to build my own knowledge palace.

In this learning journey, I will uphold curiosity and thirst for knowledge, constantly ask questions, practice, and reflect. I believe that every failure is a valuable experience to move towards success, and every persistence is a transcendence of self-limits. I will cherish every communication with my companions, draw nutrients from their wisdom and experience, grow together, and inspire each other.

Let us go hand in hand, constantly challenge ourselves and pursue excellence on this C++ learning road full of unknowns and possibilities. Whether there are thorns or a smooth road ahead, please maintain your love and persistence for programming, because it is this love that will lead us to a more brilliant tomorrow. Come on, not only for yourself, but also for those programming enthusiasts who also have dreams and are moving forward courageously!
